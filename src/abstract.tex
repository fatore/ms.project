The exploration of multidimensional data sets involves
basically two great challenges. The first one is that rarely
the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is known, i.e., the
set of variables that are really important for the comprehension
of the phenomena. The second one is related to the fact that
sometimes the main aspects that explains the problem may not
have been collected. The interactive transformation of data
is a visual based approach that seeks to solve or mitigate
these challenges. However, the available methods in the
literature have limitations in several aspects. So, the goal
of this master's project is to develop a visual tool for
interactive transformation of multidimensional data that
meets the two situations described. The first, where
irrelevant and redundant variables are removed, and the
second, that creates new variables to represent missing
information. The proposed methodology takes into account the
limitations of the state-of-art and is based on the
simplicity of the visualizations and integration of the
interactive mechanisms to overcome them.
